            Hi, I’m Nzubechukwu Emmanuel, a Software Engineering student with a
            growing passion for building impactful digital solutions. I enjoy
            creating clean and functional projects with HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
            and C, and I’m continuously advancing my skills toward Full-Stack
            Development, Artificial Intelligence, Big Data, and Cloud Computing.
            Beyond coding, I’m also into calisthenics training.
